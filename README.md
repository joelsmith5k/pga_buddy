PGA Buddy gathers and displays statistics for PGA Players. 
Original Data Source: sportsdata.io

Each week, PGA Buddy will take an updated list of the current top 50 golfers (World Golf Rankings),
and look at their historical performance at the venue that the next PGA tournament 
will be played at. The data is pulled from a custom API that I built using 
the original sportsdata.io data. This is a small personal project which I hope to 
build on in the future, please reach out with comments and/or suggestions.
