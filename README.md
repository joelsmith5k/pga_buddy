PGA Buddy gathers and displays statistics for PGA Players. 
Original Data Source: sportsdata.io

Each week, PGA Buddy will update the top 50 golfers based on World Golf Rankings,
and look at their historical performance at the venue that the next PGA tournament 
will be played at. This is a small personal project which I hope to build on in 
the future, please reach out with comments and/or suggestions.
